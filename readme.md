Hi, I'm Joris and I'm sick and tired of switching kubernetes contexts. That's why 
I created this project. If you're managing multiple kubernetes clusters with an 
admin account and you have X amount of configs in your `~/.kube/config` folder 
use this. 

I know, there are a lot of other tools on the "OpenSource Market" but this one 
just does what it needs to do, no further bullshit. 

## How to install? 

We'll that is pretty simple. 

* clone this git 
* put the script in your `/usr/local/bin` folder
* (optional step) `exec bash` just re-open your terminal will do the trick as well.
